### QOL Enhancements

**General**

- [x] Prevent symbols colliding on generation
- [x] Mouse control of view
- [x] ~New consideration: Should player only be able to move in the cardinal
      directions? Like the original game? W would be forward, S back, A to turn
      left 90°, D to turn right 90°~ Ivan says nah, but I did it anyway more than a year later.
- [ ] Improve player body (just a cube right now)
- [ ] Configurable controls (Invert mouse and such)
- [ ] World bounds
  - [ ] Choose: Physical barrier, invisible limit, or both?
  - [ ] Idea: If there is no actual limit, only the physical, and we add a jump
        ability, then the player could potentially escape the bounds and wander
        off into the darkness. We could hide an easter egg out there...

**Pause menu** (as features are added)

- [ ] Shows on ESC
- [ ] p2p multiplayer?
- Settings
  - [ ] Number of symbols
  - [ ] Board size
  - [ ] Control customization (Invert look y-axis, custom movement and look button)
  - [ ] Music and SFX volumes
- [ ] Credits

          The object is to find the most pairs before the kitten is found! (single or multiplayer)
    - [ ] Multiplayer Chat

**Cheat Codes**

- [ ] Kitten noises = true
