### QOL Enhancements

**General**

- [x] Prevent cubes colliding on generation
- [x] Mouse control of view
- [ ] ~New consideration: Should player only be able to move in the cardinal
      directions? Like the original game? W would be forward, S back, A to turn
      left 90°, D to turn right 90°~ Ivan says nah
- [x] Prevent player phasing through cubes (Collision Detection)
- [x] Give the player corporeal form
- [ ] Improve player body (just a cube right now)
- [ ] World bounds
  - [ ] Choose: Physical barrier, invisible limit, or both?
  - [ ] Idea: If there is no actual limit, only the physical, and we add a jump
        ability, then the player could potentially escape the bounds and wander
        off into the darkness. We could hide an easter egg out there...
